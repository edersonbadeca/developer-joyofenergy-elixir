# Welcome to PowerDale

information about how much power a house is drawing/using.

There are three major providers of energy in town that charge different amounts for the power they supply.

- _Dr Evil's Dark Energy
- _The Green Eco_
- _Power for Everyone_

# Introducing JOI Energy

JOI Energy is a new start-up in the energy industry. Rather than selling energy they want to differentiate themselves
from the market by recording their customers' energy usage from their smart meters and recommending the best supplier to
meet their needs.
